### Composability in the Context of CLI Tools and Bash

Composability refers to the capability to combine simple, single-purpose tools to perform complex tasks. In the context of CLI tools and Bash, it harnesses the Unix philosophy of making each program do one thing well. By chaining these tools together, users can achieve sophisticated and flexible workflows.

Here's how composability is applied in CLI tools and Bash:

1. **Pipelines**: The ability to use the output of one command as the input to another using the pipe (`|`) operator.
    ```bash
    cat file.txt | grep "search_term" | sort | uniq
    ```

2. **Redirection**: Redirecting input and output using `>`, `<`, and `>>`.
    ```bash
    grep "error" logfile.txt > errors.txt
    ```

3. **Command Substitution**: Using the output of one command within another command by enclosing it in backticks (`` ` ``) or `$(...)`.
    ```bash
    current_date=$(date)
    echo "Today's date is $current_date"
    ```

4. **Scripts**: Writing bash scripts that combine multiple commands to automate tasks.
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    find . -type f -name "*.log" | xargs grep -i "error" > error_log.txt
    ```

5. **Filters and Utilities**: Combining small utilities like `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, and `cut` to process and transform data streams.
    ```bash
    ps aux | awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $11}' | sort -k3,3n
    ```

These mechanisms allow users to build sophisticated data processing pipelines that are highly reusable, modular, and efficient.
